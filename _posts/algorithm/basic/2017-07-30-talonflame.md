a strong pokemon with decent ATK and verry high SPEED. with the ability, GALE WINGS \+1 priority on flying move, a monster in PVP. there are two ways to build a good talonflame. once is outspeed attacker, by max EVS on ATK and SPEED, almost can not be outspeeded by another pokemon (can be outspeed by extremely speed \+2 priorities ). that why there are another way to build it. maximum ATK and HP, with sword dance, gratz, you have a monster in PVP. Tanky and have nice speed with priority.
